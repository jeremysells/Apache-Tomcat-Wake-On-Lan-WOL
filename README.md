# ABOUT
Before I had a home server I used to use my desktop to do most things on including my uni work.
This lead to a problem, in which I hade to leave my desktop on 24/7.
If I went to university for the day and forgot something on my desktop I would have to get one of my flatmates to turn on my desktop so I could RDP or Logmein to it and retrieve something.
Solution: A thin client running linux off a flash drive and an apache tomcat application to WOL my pc and using dyndns and a port forward I could turn my pc back on!
